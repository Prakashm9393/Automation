# POM1.0
Page Object Model without Page Factory and Using GenericWrapper.class separate all selenium code into that class. Which makes automation code maintenance and reusability will be easier.

Using POM1.0 test automation framework we can achieve following things,

2.) Test Scripts & Test Data will maintained separately.

3.) Design Pattern - Page Object Model will be followed.

4.) In this model, page objects and page methods will be segregated.

5.) This model makes easy to maintain the Object Repository.

6.) Automation Code maintenance and reusability will be easier.
